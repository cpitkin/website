So I decided to not go crazy about all this hosting stuff and make it super simple. The new site is built with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. I just published my first [project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redirect-test) to npm and want to start helping the open source community. I do a lot of this stuff in my day job but it never hurts to keep learning.

I am also going to work hard at writing posts about the projects I am working on or just things I am interested in doing. I have imposter syndrome quite often and the only way to help me overcome this is to get out there and build stuff. Not only that but the fear of not being good enough at *insert task here* to let anyone else see my work.</insert></insert>

Heres to changing bad habits to good and moving out of my comfort zone and into the crazy.
