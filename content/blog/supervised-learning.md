I am following [this](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/why-machine-learning-matters-6164faf1df12) tutorial to get the basics of machine learning

# Supervised Learning

## Tasks of Supervised Learning
  1. regression
  2. classification

- linear regression
- loss functions
- gradient descent

Y = f(X) + E

Start with a labeled training data set

### Regression
- predicts a continuous target variable Y. It allows you to estimate a value, such as housing prices or human lifespan, based on input data X.

#### Vocabulary
- target variable: unknown variable we care about predicting
- continuous: no gaps (eg. a person's height and weight)
- discrete: can only take a finite number of values (eg. number of kids)

- mean squared error (mean squared deviation): estimator and what is estimated
