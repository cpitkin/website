I'm no stranger to diving into some code, logging into a server, or just reading some docs. When it comes to finding solutions to issues I don't mind going down the rabbit hole. I don't like to sit around and let the answer come to me, I would much rather go out and find the solution. This is not to say I don't like to collaborate. On the contrary, I very much enjoy pair programming or a random brainstorming session with a co-worker.
